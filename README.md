## Usage 
Upon readching the site you will see my homepage with a little bit about me and my life. Shown below:

<p align ="center">
<img src = "./src/components/img-files/home.jpg" alt = "homepage">
</p>

For navigation use the navbar at the top to see the different pages and links at the bottom to get directed to my Github, Linkedin or Twitter. 
<br>
<p align ="center">
<img src = "./src/components/img-files/header.jpg" alt = "header">
</p>
<p align ="center">
<img src = "./src/components/img-files/footer.jpg" alt = "footer">
</p>
<br>
On the 'My Work' tab you will find links to some of my work. Click the image to go to the functioning site or click the little cat to be taken to the repository containing the code for that app.

On the contact page information must be inclunded in all input fields including, name, email(must be a valid email) and message. Once all fields are filled out the form can be submitted. The final resume page list all of my proficiencies. User will also find a link to download a copy of my up to date resume in .pdf format.
