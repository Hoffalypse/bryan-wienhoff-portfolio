From there user must log in for create a new account. Once on the login page user has the option to log in or click the 'Signup for new Account' button to create a new user. Once logged in access will be given to the rest of the app. From the homepage user can click on any of the shown posts in order to comment on an individual post. The comment page is shown below:
